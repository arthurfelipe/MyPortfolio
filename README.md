# MyPortfolio
 
:godmode: My intentions are beyond your understanding


I wanted to make a portfolio that also acted as a place where my fellow programmers could also resort to to follow along with the stuff I research about.

I'm really into design (Ux/Ui) and I'm fascinated with simple, yet beautiful websites. Acessibility should also play a important role when you're building a website.

My goal was to build a very simple, lightweight and responsive website. I really wanted to stick with HTML & CSS only (absolutely caveman mode), which proved to be actually harder and very inefficient, since there would be a lot of ctrl c + ctrl v of code... so I decided to use some JS for template-sake.

:goberserk: AND BOY DID I SUFFER.

So yeah, I also like O.S. stuff and I think you too. That's why I kept the code simple, bug-free and sketchyness-free so you can explore it and even get some references, if you feel like it. I tried to keep it very well commented and indented, so if you are getting into HTML/CSS/JS, you can use this as a guide-through or whatever. Have fun, because I didn't have.
