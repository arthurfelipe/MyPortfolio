                <p class="abstract"><u>SUMMARY:</u>
                    In the IT field, there are many strong opinions for and against cloud computing. 
                    But what is the fuss all about? Is it actually worth it? Are some better than others? </p>

                <hr class="separator">

                <div class="textArea">
                    <p>If you open a YouTube video that even touches the subject of cloud computing, you will 
                        find people on the comments section typing either A) Cloud is the worst thing ever created 
                        or B) Cloud is magical. Reality check: It isn't either. Why?<br>
                        <br>
                        In the past, cloud resources were a complicated type of business, since subscription-based 
                        plans only gained credibility in the last couple of years (mainly because of streaming services 
                        like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify and many others). The fear of being overcharged or having your 
                        information leaked was very strong, and it was justified.

                    </p>
                    <p class="subtitle">DATA BREACHING AND OVERCHARGING</p>

                    <p>There are 2 main ways where your data could be exposed when working with cloud computing: Your 
                        sensitive data being leaked (like credit card info, personal or company data, and so on) because 
                        of weak digital security practices, or, content regarding your project being leaked (like databases 
                        and such), since you are trusting your sensitive data to another company. As time went on, new 
                        security measurements were implemented (look around, we don't even mind looking up the site' security 
                        certificates we are buying things from). This, in pair with the fact that most of the cloud resources 
                        are generally offered by well-known and well-trusted tech companies (like Google, Microsoft and Amazon) 
                        keeps bringing more assurance to people their data is actually secure (from malicious users, because 
                        these companies WILL use your data how and whenever they want to, as described in their TOSs). On top 
                        of that, these platforms also offer you, the developer, a bunch of counter measurements against DDoS 
                        & OWASP that, in the end, if well set up, should back you up against plenty of attacks (cloud-specific 
                        or even general web attacks, what is a very solid argument for these services). Platforms like Google's 
                        GCP also feature load-balancing, security policies, real time monitoring and many other features, just 
                        like your traditional server setup, usually with no extra charges.<br>
                        <br>
                        Overcharging is also a big concern when we talk about cloud computing. We have all heard companies 
                        that made one silly mistake which cost them upwards of 20 THOUSAND dollars. And you also have normal, 
                        everyday users that slipped their fingers and sent 1 thousand bucks down the drain in a couple of hours. 
                        The most common counter measurement is to set a spend limit (which, as far as I know Google offers and 
                        insists that you use it in their course). You can also set usage limits, so you don't exceed your quota. 
                        On top of that, some companies don't want to be the "bad guys": Google doesn't want you to spend 5 grand 
                        by mistake, keep it and then risk their own image or stock prices. That may vary a lot, since you will 
                        be relying solely on the company' mercy and customer relationship policy. My tip for you? Don't rely on 
                        that. Keep a very tight spending quota, so if things go south, you and your company are both safe.

                    <p class="subtitle">EASE OF USE AND RESOURCES</p>

                    <p>Working with either locally hosted servers or cloud hosted servers requires some knowledge, especially 
                        if you are, for example, dealing with an important website, known to have many visitors around the world, 
                        and should have >99% of availability. My biggest experience is with Google's GCP, and as far as I can 
                        tell, the UI is very straight-forward, documentation is VERY well done and there are plenty of courses! 
                        Google even offers you plenty of hands-on experience with their courses, which I absolutely recommend 
                        (and this post is not sponsored by any means, I just dig the service a bunch). I've had more problems 
                        with AWS, but that's out of the scope.
                    </p>

                    <p class="subtitle">PRICING</p>

                    <p>That's the fun part. If you have big needs, to host a local server, you have to consider:</p>
                    
                        <li>Buying the server itself;</li>
                        <li>Having a team for maintenance, update and set up;</li>
                        <li>Buying add-ons (like room cooling solutions, cables, routers, switches, no-breaks, 
                            sound deadening liners...);</li>
                        <li>Dealing with disasters (like fire, water, dust, animals, intruders...);</li>
                        <li>Dealing with downtime for maintenance or updates;</li>
                        <li>Electrical expenses;</li>
                        <li>Enterprise-level internet connection expenses;</li>
                        <li>A separate room only for the server...</li>
                    
                    <p>And the costs only go up. I have no doubts that the expense, plus the inconvenience of hosting your 
                        own server is enough to make you move to a cloud hosted service. Don't get me wrong, it is still going 
                        to be expensive, but less. And, usually, you pay for what you use, so in a month that you use less 
                        resources, you will actually pay less than usual.<br>
                        <br>
                        For small businesses, I also recommend cloud-based alternatives, since there are very low-buck options 
                        that are more than capable of dealing with the load, and the AVAILABILITY and RELIABILITY are just 
                        unbeatable (for the price, at least). Way better than using a 7y.o. dual core as a makeshift server.<br>
                        <br>
                        But, if you have a medium-sized business that can get by with a core i7 or i9, I really recommend 
                        sticking to the locally hosted server (if you can deal with downtime in some way). Why? In this tier, 
                        cloud hosting prices are actually quite high, to the point that, in the long run, it's cheaper to 
                        have your own solution. On top of that, a core i7 or i9 server is still quite small and isn't much 
                        of a hassle. Of course, you will have to come up with your own solution regarding attacks and updates, 
                        but that's on you to decide. Also, you have to consider your company's growth: Does your company have 
                        the chance of, in the near future, becoming a big company, with big needs? If yes, maybe you should 
                        consider a cloud-based solution from the very beginning, so you don't have to spend money twice 
                        (buying a decent local server and then after a couple of years having to rent a web server is no 
                        good). That's why it is so important to know your business and plan every spend with caution. 
                        Don't rely on a guy on the internet, real data is unbeatable.<br>
